# Game Hackathon

As a pair we had one day to plan and build an app in JavaScript that fetched and displayed data from an API. In a pair, we completed this project in week 2 of the School of Code bootcamp to apply our newfound knowledge of REST APIs.

We chose a Pok√©mon database API to get info from and used the data to make a top trumps game. We were happy with what we achieved in just 7 or so hours, especially the functionality of the app. The only thing we felt needed real improvement was CSS, which is something we will revisit at some point.

## Run the game locally

1. clone the repo.
2. copy the path of the HTML file and run it in your browser.
